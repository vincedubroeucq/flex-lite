== Description ==

A simple and clean responsive theme for your personal blog.

The theme is very simple to use and supports WordPress' core functionalities:
 - custom logo 
 - custom-background
 - custom-header
 - custom-menu
 - featured images (post thumbnails)
 
There are three widget areas:
 - The main widget area is the blog sidebar. Without any widget in this sidebar, the blog will display as a single column layout.
 - The after post widget area is best used for signup forms. It appears at the end of blog posts only on single page views. 
 - The front page widget area is used to build the front page of your site. Just create a page, select the widgetized front page template, and the widgets you add to this widget area will appear on this page.

The theme also provides you with two unique widgets to help you build your front page:
 - The Featured Page Widget allows you to insert a specific page content on your front page or in your sidebar. Choose your page and display its thumbnail on the left, right, and choose text alignment.
 - The Recent Posts Widget allows you to add nice recent posts boxes on your homepage. Choose whether you want to display the thumbnail, excerpt or post meta information.

The Customizer features two new sections: 
 - Social Icons section : Just add your social media profiles in there to display a nice icon in the main header and the footer linking to your profiles.
 - Footer Section : customize the text appearing in the footer.

Warning: The main menu is limited to a depth of 2. That means you can have dropdowns one level deep, not two.
